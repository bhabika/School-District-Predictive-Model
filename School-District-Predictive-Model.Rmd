# Introduction

The categorization of school districts in the United States is important, as it can impact the funding that schools get, the number of students in these schools, and the overall resources that are provided to the districts and individual schools. Smaller areas such as rural or micropolitan districts may have higher per-pupil human capital cost (Dhaliwal & Bruno, 2021) and therefore see differences in funding levels which can have implications for policy and practice. A model that can predict type of district based on various independent variables such as disability or economic status could help lead policymakers and financial bureaucracies in investing federal funds into the districts that need the funding the most.

## The Data

The following data set lists various metro and micro counties in the USA and of these counties, describes average test scores for economically and non-economically disadvantaged students, % of students by race, language status, and disability diagnosis, total enrollment of students from Grades 3-8, and % of population of people with bachelors or higher, % unemployed, and % impoverished.

- **Source** = The data were gathered from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA). The metro/micro ID and names were gathered from the 2017-2021 Statistics of U.S. Businesses at census.gov. Information about percentage of each race in the grade and achieve data was collected from the Common Core of Data (CCD) and the EDFacts data system housed by the U.S. Department of Education (Fahle et al., 2021; Reardon et al., 2022).
- **Sample Size** = The sample size is 933 metro and micro counties in the USA.
- **Outcome Variable** = The outcome variable is the binary variable: metro or micro district. Metropolitan districts contain a population of 50,000 or more people, while micropolitan districts have populations less than 50,000 but more than 10,000 people (Federal Reserve System, 2023).
- **Predictor Variables** = The predictor variables are average test scores, economic status, disability diagnosis, and language status (English Language Learner).
- **Individual Differences** = Individual differences in the samples can be seen in a variety of ways, including disability, economic, and linguistic status.
- **Demographics** = The demographics of the population are listed according to economic status (economically disadvantaged or not, population in poverty, etc.), disability diagnosis (identified as special education), language status (ELL), and average test scores from 3rd to 8th graders in those districts.

## Research Question

1. Can components derived from the SEDA data set using a PCA predict whether 3rd to 8th graders live in micropolitan or metropolitan districts in the United States?

# Basics

First, clear memory and bring in the packages we need.

```{r}
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) 
library(tidyverse) #call in tidyverse #data science
library(dplyr) #call in dplyr #data manipulation
```

## Call in Data

```{r}

data <- read_csv("LearningAnalysticsdataset.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) #Bring in the CSV file
str(data) #Check the structure to make sure our variables are correctly identified as "character" or "numeric"

```

## Data Wrangling

This SEDA data set has some level of data cleaning already. There are no NAs or missing data. Still, I removed the first two columns from the data set since the ID and name of the districts are not applicable for the analysis. The variable accounting for percentage of urban population in the district was also removed to avoid redundancy when creating a prediction model. All other variables were kept for the analysis. I also renamed the variables of interest in the data set so they look cleaner for our analysis.

```{r}

data_pca <- data[,c(3:6, 8:19)] #I only want to analyze my variables of interest

#rename the variables using the dplyr package
data_pca <- data_pca %>% rename(Average_Test_Scores = avg_test_all, Average_Scores_EcoDisadvantaged = avg_test_ecd, Average_Scores_NotEcoDisadvantaged = avg_test_nec, Metro_or_Micro = metro_or_micro, Percent_English_Language_Learner = perell, Percent_Special_Education = perspeced, Percent_NativeAmerican = pernam, Percent_Asian = perasn, Percent_Hispanic = perhsp, Percent_Black = perblk, Percent_White = perwht, Percent_EcoDisadvantaged = perecd, Total_Enrollment = totenrl, Percent_Bachelors = perbaplus, Percent_Unemployed = perunemp, Population_Poverty = perpoverty)

str(data_pca)

```

## Check for Multicollinearity

```{r}

#check for multicollinearity

data_corr <- data_pca[, c(1:3, 5:16)] #create a tibble of the predictor variables
#remove metro/micro for correlation analysis
str(data_corr) 

cor(data_corr) #check correlation

#no threats of multicollinearity #let's see it graphically just to make sure too

```

```{r}
#install.packages("corrplot") #install the correlation package; if already installed, move to the next line

library(corrplot) #call in the package #visualization for the correlation matrix

cor_matrix <- abs(cor(data_corr)) #make the values absolute
cor_matrix_2 <- cor(data_corr)

corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         type="lower",
         tl.pos = "ld", #position of text labels #left and diagonal
         tl.cex = .5, #size of the label
         method="color", col=colorRampPalette(c("white","lightpink","salmon"))
         (100),col.lim=c(0,1),
         addCoef.col="chocolate3", #color of numbers
         diag=FALSE,
         tl.col="firebrick4", #color of text label
         tl.srt=45, #numeric rotation
         is.corr = FALSE, #if you include correlation matrix
         order = "hclust", #order results by strength
         number.cex = 0.5, #change size of the 
         number.digits = 2) #number of digits after decimal

```

The strongest correlation is 0.86 between average test scores and average test scores for non-economically disadvantaged students. None are at or above 0.90.

## Scale variables

Next, let's scale the variables.

```{r}
library(psych) #toolbox for psychometric theory

str(data_corr)

scaled_data_pca <- data_corr %>% 
  mutate_at(c(1:15), ~(scale(.) %>% as.vector))

str(scaled_data_pca)
psych::describe(scaled_data_pca) #gives you descriptive data like mean, SD, etc.


```

# Visualize the data

In order to analyze a large number of variables, increase comprehension of the data set, and minimize data loss, I conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe & Cadima, 2016).

```{r}

#install.packages("factoextra")
library(factoextra) #we use this package to visualize PCA

viz_pca <- prcomp(scaled_data_pca, center = TRUE,scale. = TRUE) #run the visualization


#positive correlated variables point to the same side of the plot and negative correlated variables point to opposite sides of the graph

fviz_pca_var(viz_pca,
             col.var = "contrib", # Color by contributions to the PC
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE #Avoid overlapping text if possible 
             )

```

## Bartlett's test 

Next, we conduct a Bartlettâ€™s Test of Sphericity to see if the variables are correlated. If the correlation matrix is an identity matrix, the data may not be suitable for factor analysis (Analysis INN, 2020).

```{r}
cortest.bartlett(scaled_data_pca, 933) #933 equals sample size

# p value was less than .05 so r-matrix is significant and not an identity matrix
```

## KMO

We conduct the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy. The KMO measures the strength of the correlation with values below .5 considered unacceptable and values above .9 considered superb (Analysis INN, 2020).

```{r}

KMO(scaled_data_pca) #make sure everything is above .50

```

From this analysis, we see that 5 variables are under .50 (Percent_NativeAmerican, Percent_Hispanic, Percent_White, Percent_Asian, and Percent_Black). We remove the smallest of these variables (Percent_NativeAmerican) and run the KMO again.

```{r}

str(scaled_data_pca)

draft_scaled_data_pca <- scaled_data_pca[, c(1:5, 7:15)]

str(draft_scaled_data_pca)

KMO(draft_scaled_data_pca) #make sure everything is above .50 #Percent_Asian and Percent_Black are still below 0.50 so let's remove the smaller of these two variables (Percent_Black) and run the KMO again

final_scaled_data_pca <- draft_scaled_data_pca[, c(1:7, 9:14)]

str(final_scaled_data_pca) #check to make sure Percent_Black is removed from the analysis

KMO(final_scaled_data_pca) #everything is above .50

```

Overall MSA =  0.69 so we are good to move on to the next step.

# PCA
## Baseline PCA

```{r}

#run a base pca with the available variables after checking for KMO and Bartlett's test #here we have 10

pca_base <- principal(final_scaled_data_pca, nfactors = 13, rotate = "none")

pca_base #results

#check to see how many SS loadings are above 1

#potentialy 4 here with PC1 at 5.24, PC2 at 2.70, PC3 at 1.59, and PC4 at 1.07

#conduct a scree plot using eigen values
plot(pca_base$values, type = "b")

#this visualization shows the eigenvalues (y) against the factor number (x)
#type = 'b' indicates the plot point and line on the graph

#indicates 4 variables here

```

## Normal Distribution

Next, we will check to see that our residuals are normally distributed. 

```{r}

pca_resid <- principal(final_scaled_data_pca, nfactors = 4, rotate = "none")
pca_resid 

#residuals
#we need correlation matrix
corMatrix<-cor(final_scaled_data_pca)

#next, create an object for residuals
residuals<-factor.residuals(corMatrix, pca_resid$loadings)

#call histogram to check for residuals
hist(residuals) #looks like a pretty normal distribution with a slight right skew


```

## Final PCA

Since our factors are most likely related, we will use the oblique technique (promax).

```{r}

pca_final <- principal(final_scaled_data_pca, nfactors = 4, rotate = "promax") #oblique
pca_final #results

print.psych(pca_final, cut = 0.3, sort = TRUE)

```

The SS loadings at 2.84, 2.64, 2.57, 1.92 indicate that the relationship is stronger after rotating.

## Interpretation

```{r}

plot(pca_final)

#component 1 is black
#component 2 is blue
#component 3 is red
#component 4 is grey

fa.diagram(pca_final)

```

*Here we see four components. The components can be named as following:*

**Component 1**: Disadvantaged_students

**Component 2**: Specialized_demographics

**Component 3**: Urban_students

**Component 4**: Test_scores

## CSV

```{r}

#we need the pca scores
pca_final_scores <- as.data.frame(pca_final$scores) #scores for each factor

#rename using the component names we chose
pca_final_scores <- pca_final_scores %>% 
  rename(Disadvantaged_students = RC1, Specialized_demographics = RC2, Urban_students = RC3, Test_scores = RC4)

#combine df

str(data)

final_data <- cbind(data, pca_final_scores)
str(final_data)


write.csv(final_data,"metromicro_pca.csv", row.names=FALSE)


```

# Machine Learning

```{r}

model <- read_csv("metromicro_pca.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) #Bring in the final CSV file
str(model) #Check the structure to make sure our variables are correctly identified as "character" or "numeric"

#we only want our outcome and predictor variables

model_lr <- model[,c(6, 20:23)] #I only want to analyze my variables of interest

#rename the variables using the dplyr package
model_lr <- model_lr %>% rename(Metro_or_Micro = metro_or_micro)

str(model_lr)

```

## Data Descriptives

*Make sure outcome variable is binary*

Outcome variable of interest is type of district (metropolitan or micropolitan). The outcome variable is binary. Students will either come from a metropolitan or micropolitan district.

*Check to make sure classes are roughly balanced*

```{r}

library(plyr) #download the package plyr to check frequency count of each class
count(model_lr$Metro_or_Micro) #check count of each class

#there are 400 metro school districts and 533 micro school districts in the data set

```

Industry standard states that to be balanced, minority classes (the smaller of the class) should be at least 40% of the proportion of the data set. Here, n=400 (minority class) is over 40% of the data set (n=933). Through the following visualization and industry standard, we can claim that the classes are balanced (Google Developers, 2022).

```{r} 

barplot(prop.table(table(model_lr$Metro_or_Micro)),
        col = rainbow(2),
        ylim = c(0, 0.7),
        main = "District Distribution") #visualization of classes
```

*Scale numeric predictor variables*

```{r}

model_scaled <- model_lr %>% 
  mutate_at(c(2:5), ~(scale(.) %>% as.vector))
  #scale all variables except the outcome variable so mean is zero and values are standardized to SD from zero

str(model_scaled)

psych::describe(model_scaled) #from this summary description, I see that all numeric variables have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1

```

**Make sure outcome variable is a factor**

```{r}
#the outcome variable label is currently numeric and it needs to be a factor

model_scaled$Metro_or_Micro <- as.factor(model_scaled$Metro_or_Micro) #Metro is "1" and Micro is "2"

str(model_scaled) #check structure to make sure that "label" variable is now a factor, which checks out!

table(model_scaled$Metro_or_Micro) #as number of people in micro are more, we predict model will predict more students in micro districts

```

*The outcome variable is the type of district and the predictor variables are the four components gathered from the PCA above.*

## Check for Suppression Effects

```{r}

model_scaled %>% 
  group_by(Metro_or_Micro) %>% 
  summarise_at(1:4, funs(mean, sd)) #when using the group-by function, R assumes that the tibble has only has 4 variables #get the mean and SD of each of the predictor variables based on the outcome variable binary

```

The difference between the two types of districts for Disadvantaged_students is .3, Specialized_demographics is .26, Test_scores is .08, and Urban_students is 1.05. This indicates that the strongest discriminator between the metro and micro districts is urban identification of students and the weakest discriminator is test scores of students.

## Check for Multicollinearity

*Check for multicollinearity*

```{r}

#check for multicollinearity

model_corr <- model_scaled[, c(2:5)] #create a tibble of the predictor variables
  
cor(model_corr) #check correlation

#no threats of multicollinearity

```
The data tables above further shows that there is no suppression effect nor multicollinearity so we can move ahead to creating a predictive model for the data set. We can see that when the correlations are ordered by strength, the strongest correlation is .57 so there is no evidence of multicollinearity (>.80) in the data.

## Regression model

**10 fold cross-validation**

Next, we are going to use a statistical resampling procedure method called 10-fold cross validation to test the strength of our model (Brownlee, 2018). We will use the PCA data we have from our given data set to analyze how well this model can make predictions outside of this data set.

```{r}

library(caret) #call in the caret package #Classification And REgression Training #simplifies the creation of predictive models
library(MASS) #call in the mass package #Modern Applied Statistics with S

#set seed
set.seed(123)

# Set up repeated k-fold cross-validation
train.control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
#method CV means cross validation, number is 10 because we are doing 10 fold cross-validation


#the LM model used
lr_cv10 <- train(Metro_or_Micro ~., #~. indicates to pull all variables after Metro_or_Micro
                 data = model_scaled, #our dataset
                 method="glmStepAIC", # Step wise AIC (estimator of prediction error) from maas package
                 direction="backward",
                 trControl = train.control,
                 family = "binomial")


summary(lr_cv10) #find residuals and average #Urban_students and Test_scores are significant

str(lr_cv10)

```

**Get predicted and actual values**

```{r}

predicted <- unname(lr_cv10$finalModel$fitted.values) #change named vector to unname

model_scaled$predicted.probabilities<-predicted #get predicted values

model_scaled <- model_scaled %>% 
  #assign 1 to Metropolitan Districts, 2 to Micropolitan Districts
  mutate(actual = ifelse(Metro_or_Micro == "Metro", 1, 2)) %>% 
  #assign 1 to .50 and less and 2 to anything else 
  mutate(predicted = ifelse(predicted.probabilities < .50, 1, 2))

#create factors for predicted and actual
model_scaled$predicted <- as.factor(model_scaled$predicted)
model_scaled$actual <- as.factor(model_scaled$actual)

str(model_scaled)
table(model_scaled$actual) #let's see our final values

# create confusion matrix using the confusionMatrix function
confusionMatrix(model_scaled$actual, model_scaled$predicted,
                mode = "everything", 
                positive="1") #positive values represent Metro districts

```


## Mosaic Plot

```{r}

#first make a table
mosaic_table <- table(model_scaled$actual, model_scaled$predicted)
mosaic_table #make sure everything looks good with the table

```

```{r}

#next plot a simple mosaic
mosaicplot(mosaic_table,
           main = "Confusion Matrix",
           sub = "Accuracy of Prediction",
           xlab = "Predicted",
           ylab = "Actual",
           color = "lightgray",
           border = "black")


```

*Summary of Confusion Matrix Interpretation*

- True Positive: Model correctly predicted 265 cases as Metro and it was actually Metro.
- False Positive: Model incorrectly predicted 135 cases as Metro but it was actually Micro
- False Negative: Model incorrectly predicted 64 cases as Micro but it was actually Metro.
- True Negative: Model correctly predicted 469 cases as Micro and it was actually Micro.

The model is 79% accurate with a Kappa value of 0.5547 (we can interpret this as moderate to substantial agreement between the observed and predicted values), Precision value of 0.6625 (TP/(TP+FP)), Recall value of 0.8055 (TP/(TP+FN)), and F1 value of 0.7270 (the balanced score between recall and precision).

# Discussion
